## Project overview
**POLAR** (*Polemics in Online Language and Automated Recognition*) is a 24-month collaborative research project funded within the **YUFE Alliance** and hosted at **Université Sorbonne Nouvelle**.

The project investigates how online speakers express stance and controversy through **covert or overt discursive strategies** (e.g., distancing, alignment, rhetorical questions or remarks), and how such strategies can be **identified qualitatively** and then **detected automatically**. 

## Research aims
POLAR has two main scientific objectives:
1. **Identify and describe** distance/controversy markers functioning as polemic markers, and model how they operate in context.
2. **Explore tool-assisted approaches** (automatic annotation, detection, clustering/text mining) and refine automatic decision-making for polemic detection.

## Method in a nutshell
We combine:
- **Qualitative analysis**: manual identification of polemical strategies across linguistic, abstract (e.g., irony/metaphor), and argumentation levels.
- **Quantitative & computational work**: annotation, machine learning / NLP, and evaluation on large-scale social media data. 

## Planned activities
- A series of **interdisciplinary webinars** (4–5 across the project) starting from May 2026.  
- Regular collaboration meetings and in-person workshops.
- A final **colloquium/conference** to present results and foster future collaborations.
